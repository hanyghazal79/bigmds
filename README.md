*MDS* is a statistic tool for reduction of dimensionality, using as
input a distance matrix of dimensions *n Ã— n*. When *n* is large,
classical algorithms suffer from computational problems and *MDS*
configuration can not be obtained.

With this package, we address these problems by means of three
algorithms:

  - Divide-and-conquer MDS.
  - Fast MDS.
  - Interpolation MDS.

The main idea of these methods is based on partitioning the dataset into
small pieces, where classical methods can work. *Fast MDS* was developed
by *Yang, T., J. Liu, L. McMillan, and W. Wang (2006)*, whereas
*divide-and-conquer MDS* and *interpolation MDS* were developed by
*Delicado P. and C. Pachon-Garcia (2021).*

## Installation

You can install directly from CRAN with:

``` r
# install.packages("bigmds")
```

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pachoning/bigmds")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
set.seed(42)
library(bigmds)
x <- matrix(data = rnorm(4*10000), nrow = 10000) %*% diag(c(9, 4, 1, 1))

divide_mds_conf <- divide_conquer_mds(x = x, l = 200, c_points = 2*2, r = 2, n_cores = 1, dist_fn = stats::dist)
head(divide_mds_conf$points)

fast_mds_conf <- fast_mds(x = x, l = 200, s_points = 2*2, r = 2, n_cores = 1, dist_fn = stats::dist)
head(fast_mds_conf$points)

With the implementation of *classical MDS*, it takes much more time to
obtain a MDS configuration due to computational problems. Try it
yourself\!

``` r
x <- matrix(data = rnorm(4*10000, sd = 10), nrow = 10000)
dist_matrix <- stats::dist(x = x)
mds_result <- stats::cmdscale(d = dist_matrix, k = 2, eig = TRUE)
```
