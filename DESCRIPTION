Description: We present a set of algorithms for Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to be used with large datasets. MDS is a statistic tool for reduction of dimensionality, using as input a distance matrix of dimensions n Ã— n. 
  When n is large, classical algorithms suffer from computational problems and MDS configuration can not be obtained.
  With this package, we address these problems by means of three algorithms: 
  - Divide and Conquer MDS debeloped by Delicado and Pachon-Garcia (2020) <arXiv:2007.11919>.
  - Fast MDS, which is an implementation of Yang, Tynia & Liu, Jinze & Mcmillan, Leonard & Wang, Wei, (2006).
  - MDS based on Gower interpolation, which uses Gower interpolation formula developend in Borg and Groenen 
  (1997, ISBN: 78-0-387-28981-6).
  The main idea of these methods is based on partitioning the dataset into small pieces, where classical methods can work.
